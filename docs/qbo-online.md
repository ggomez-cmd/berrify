# QuickBooks Online

Kane Rum Bar stays on QuickBooks Desktop (Web Connector). Another restaurant
connects QuickBooks Online on its own card. Send uses that restaurant’s
connection only: a Desktop invoice never posts to the Online company, and an
Online invoice never queues a Web Connector BillAdd.

Berrify does not create vendors or accounts. IIF and CSV export are unchanged.
Bills are created only when a manager clicks Send.

## Connect

1. In the Intuit developer app, set the redirect URL to
   `https://berrify.app/api/qbo/callback` (or `{PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/qbo/callback`).
2. Set Worker secrets (values stay out of the repo):

```bash
npx wrangler secret put INTUIT_CLIENT_ID
npx wrangler secret put INTUIT_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Optional: `INTUIT_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` uses the sandbox Accounting API. The
default is production.

3. Apply the new migration (do not use `db:push`):

```bash
npm run db:apply -- 0026_quickbooks_online.sql
```

4. Open QuickBooks, pick the restaurant, and click **Connect QuickBooks Online**.
   If the Worker secrets are missing, the button explains that and shows the
   redirect URL.
5. After Intuit redirects back, Berrify stores that restaurant’s realm and
   refresh token and syncs vendors and accounts for that company only.

Review dropdowns for that restaurant use those vendors and accounts. Send
posts `POST /v3/company/{realmId}/bill` with `VendorRef` and `AccountRef` ids
and saves the QuickBooks Online Bill id on `invoices.quickbooks_txn_id`.
If the vendor is missing, the send fails with Intuit’s message. Berrify does
not call VendorAdd.
